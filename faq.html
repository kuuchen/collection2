				None of this journal is supposed to be crystal clear or easy to understand, as it is an abstract condensed representation of how the cities I traveled to looked through my eyes and experiences. 
			</p>

				Parallax is sort of a visual journal of my time in Europe this summer. I saw, felt, explored, thought, and listened to a lot of things there, and this journal is the result of it. I carried my camera with me most of the time as I was walking around, and took photos in places that I felt I could visualise someone there. This someone materialises as the character who appears throughout my photos, as one who may function as a parallel vision of mine as well as their own idiosyncratic being.
			</p>
			<p>
				The character themselves is largely inspired by my interest in and identification with East Asian culture, as well as the character designs from the Fire Emblem Fates game series. I’ve always been interested in character design, so I melded my character together keeping in mind the character’s possible story. There is no detailed backstory for the character, and they are not meant to be realistic at all. They are simply anachronistic, from a realm of my imagination that isn't the world we live in. 
			</p>
			<p>
				As for the quotes that accompany each entry, they are lyrics from songs that resonate not just with me, but also with my character. Words that one would say, if they were suddenly in a completely new place, away from the comfort of a previous time, community, and space, forced to adapt to the new and reflect on the old.
